# Pro features

Four license-gated capabilities ride on top of the standard SwarmCLI TUI.
All of them require:

- A valid (or in-grace) Business Edition license — see [License](license.md).
- A managed Docker context (i.e. a Swarm that has been put through
  [`:bootstrap`](bootstrap.md)). The features talk to the agent over the
  RBAC proxy; on a non-managed context they are unavailable.

## Shell into a service task

Press `x` on any row in the Services view to open an interactive shell
inside one of the service's running tasks.

If the service has multiple replicas, a picker dialog lists each running
task ("Replica N — hostname"). Use the arrow keys to choose, `Enter` to
confirm, `Esc` to cancel. Single-replica services skip the picker.

### Working in the shell

The shell takes over your terminal for the session — it is not drawn inside
the SwarmCLI TUI. Your terminal's own scrollback, text selection and copy
therefore work as they always do: scroll up with the mouse wheel (or your
terminal's scrollback keys, e.g. `Shift+PageUp`), select across more than a
screenful of output, and copy normally. Full-screen programs in the container
(`vim`, `htop`, `less`) work too, because keystrokes pass straight through.

A one-line header, black on green, marks the start of the session and then
scrolls away with the output like any other line:

```
<<SWC-Shell>> Service: <stack>/<service> | Host: <node>        ctrl+] exit
```

For as long as the session is attached, your terminal's title names it and the
key that leaves it:

```
SwarmCLI: <stack>/<service> — ctrl+] detach
```

Unlike the header, the title does not scroll away, and it stays put while a
full-screen program is running. Your own title comes back when you detach.
Terminals that show no title are the exception, as is `vim`, which sets its own.

To leave the shell:

- **`Ctrl+]`** detaches immediately and returns to the TUI. Use this when a
  program is in the foreground or the shell is unresponsive.
- **`Ctrl+D`**, or typing **`exit`**, quits the remote shell the usual way,
  which also returns you to the TUI.

Every other key — `Ctrl+C`, `Ctrl+Z`, arrows, tab — goes to the remote shell
unchanged.

### What happens when you press `x`

The session is brokered by the infrastructure `:bootstrap` deploys: swarmcli
opens an authenticated, encrypted connection to the RBAC proxy, which
authorizes the request before anything reaches the node the task is running
on. Only then is a shell started in the container.

Authorization is enforced by the proxy, not by the TUI — a non-admin is
refused with `exec on protected stack requires admin role` whatever client
they use. See [RBAC — Roles](rbac.md#roles).

### Shell selection

If you don't override the command, the agent auto-detects an available
shell on the target container in this order:

1. `/bin/bash`
2. `/bin/sh`
3. `/bin/ash`

To force a specific command, set `SWARMCLI_SHELL_CMD` before launching
SwarmCLI:

```bash
SWARMCLI_SHELL_CMD=/usr/bin/zsh swarmcli
```

Once attached, SwarmCLI propagates terminal resizes to the remote PTY
automatically as you resize your window.

### Failure modes

| What you see | Cause |
|---|---|
| `403 exec on protected stack requires admin role` | The current managed context's user is not an admin. Switch to an admin context. |
| Connection failed / WebSocket closed | The rbac-proxy is unreachable, or the agent-manager could not reach the per-node agent. Check `:bootstrap --check`. |
| `EXEC_ERROR: no shell available` | The container image lacks `bash`, `sh`, and `ash`. Set `SWARMCLI_SHELL_CMD` to an executable that does exist in the image. |
| `Service not found` / `task not running` | Task state changed between selection and exec. Refresh the view and retry. |

## Reveal a secret

Press `x` on a row in the Secrets view to reveal the secret's contents.

Docker Swarm intentionally provides no read API for secret material; the
only way to read a secret is to mount it into a running container.
SwarmCLI BE automates that pattern:

1. A short-lived service `swarmcli-reveal-<name>-<unix-ts>` is created,
   mounting the secret at `/run/secrets/<name>`.
2. The service runs `sh -c "cat /run/secrets/<name> && sleep 10"`.
3. SwarmCLI polls the service's logs every 300 ms for up to 20 seconds.
4. Output is parsed: if it looks like printable base64, the decoded form
   is shown alongside the raw value.
5. The temporary service is removed in a `defer` — even on error or
   timeout — so a failed reveal does not leave debris behind.

The image used for the temporary service is `alpine:latest` by default.
Override with `SWARMCLI_REVEAL_IMAGE` for offline environments or a
hardened base:

```bash
SWARMCLI_REVEAL_IMAGE=registry.example.com/internal/alpine:3.20 swarmcli
```

### Security notes

Reveal-secret is a debugging tool, not a vault read. While the operation
is in flight:

- The secret material lives in a container's filesystem at
  `/run/secrets/<name>`.
- The secret material is emitted to that container's stdout, which means
  it is visible to anyone with `docker service logs` access on the
  manager hosting the task.
- The temporary service is observable via `docker service ls` for
  ~20 seconds.

The same audit record applies as any other Swarm service create/remove —
the rbac-proxy logs the calls, and Docker's daemon audit (if any) does
likewise. If your threat model requires that secret material never leave
the manager's secret store, do not enable reveal-secret for users you
don't trust to read the cleartext.

### Failure modes

| What you see | Cause |
|---|---|
| "Reveal timed out — no output captured" | Image pull stalled, the node has no scheduling capacity, or the secret file is unreadable inside the container. The view will surface task diagnostics when present. |
| Image pull failure | `SWARMCLI_REVEAL_IMAGE` cannot be pulled by the node. Use an image already cached on the node, or pre-pull. |
| `Forbidden` (403) | A non-admin user is invoking reveal — the underlying `service create` is gated. Switch to an admin context. |

## Port-forward a container port

Press `w` on any row in the Services view to open a port-forward dialog,
or use the command bar: `:port-forward <service> <local>:<remote>`
(alias `:pf <service> <local>:<remote>`). This forwards a port on your
local machine to a port inside one of the service's running tasks —
analogous to `kubectl port-forward`.

If the service has multiple replicas a picker dialog lists each running
task; pick one and the forward targets that specific task. Single-replica
services skip the picker.

### How it routes

Port-forward traffic travels over the same authenticated proxy path as
`exec` and `logs`: the local listener on `127.0.0.1` tunnels through the
rbac-proxy to the on-node agent, which connects to the target container.
Who is allowed to forward is enforced centrally — see
[Permissions](#permissions) and [RBAC — Roles](rbac.md#roles).

### Bind address policy

The local listener always binds `127.0.0.1`. This is **not** configurable
— exposing a forwarded internal service on `0.0.0.0` is too easy to do
by accident, especially on laptops on shared networks. If you need to
share a forwarded port with a teammate, use a separate tunnel.

Local ports below 1024 are rejected at validation time (they would
require root privileges and are easy to confuse with a system service).
Use a port in the 1024–65535 range, or pass `0` to let the OS pick an
ephemeral port — the chosen port is then displayed in the dialog.

### Managing active forwards

Open `:port-forwards` (alias `:pf`) to see a list of active forwards:

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Service / Slot / Node | The replica the forward is bound to. |
| Container | Truncated container ID. |
| `LP→RP` | `127.0.0.1:LOCAL → CONTAINER_PORT`. |
| State | `live`, `closing`, or `dead`. |
| Bytes In / Out | Cumulative byte counts since the forward was opened. |
| Conns | Currently open TCP connections through this forward. |

Hotkeys in the list view: `Enter` inspect, `d` close, `r` close + reopen
with the same ports.

### Lifecycle

A forward stays alive for the lifetime of the SwarmCLI process. Closing
the dialog or navigating away from the list view does **not** tear it
down — only an explicit `d` (close) or quitting the TUI ends a forward.
On quit, every listener is drained and every WebSocket is closed cleanly
before the process exits.

A forward does not survive these events:

- **Container restart or reschedule.** The forward dies; reopen it (the
  new task may live on a different node, so silent re-resolution would
  hide intent).
- **Agent restart or unreachable.** The forward dies; the local listener
  is closed so subsequent connection attempts fail loudly rather than
  blackholing.
- **30 minutes of zero traffic.** The idle timeout closes the forward.
  Override via `SWARMCLI_FORWARD_IDLE_TIMEOUT` (capped at 24 h).

### Host kernel requirements

Port-forwarding needs privileges on the agent service that `:bootstrap`
grants for you. Hardened hosts are supported, including the default process-tracing
restrictions on Ubuntu, Debian and Fedora, and containers whose main process
runs as a non-root user.

If you bootstrapped on a swarm before those privileges were part of the stack,
re-run `:bootstrap` to apply the current spec. The agent says so at startup
when it is missing one, so the misconfiguration shows up in
`docker service logs <stack>_agent` rather than only on the next port-forward
attempt.

**Known limitation — SELinux enforcing hosts.** RHEL / CentOS / Fedora
with `container_t` enforcing may still deny port-forwarding even with
both caps present. Workaround today is `--security-opt label=disable` on
the agent service. Open an issue if you hit this; a documented
stack-template toggle is on the roadmap.

### Permissions

Forwarding to a task on the **protected (infrastructure) stack** is
denied for **every role, including admin** — stricter than exec, where
admins are allowed.

Forwarding to any non-protected task is allowed for all authenticated
users (same as exec).

See [RBAC — Roles](rbac.md#roles).

### Failure modes

| What you see | Cause |
|---|---|
| `Port-forward requires Business Edition` | No valid license; open `:license`. |
| `Permission denied: forwarding to <stack> requires admin role` | Non-admin user attempting to forward to a non-admin-allowed target. Use a different context. |
| `forward on protected stack is not permitted` | Even an admin has tried to forward to the infrastructure stack. This is blocked by design. |
| `local port N is already in use` | Choose another port, or pass `0` for an OS-assigned ephemeral port. |
| `local ports below 1024 are not supported; pick 1024–65535` | Use a non-privileged port. |
| `forward closed: target port not reachable` | The container is up but nothing is listening on that port — typo, or the service hasn't bound yet. |
| `forward closed: agent disconnected` | The on-node agent is down or its network path broke. Check `:bootstrap --check`. |
| `forward target task is no longer running` | The container restarted or moved nodes. Reopen the forward. |

## Container statistics

Press `t` on any row in the Services view to graph one container's CPU,
memory, network and block I/O over time. Press `p` first to expand a
service's tasks and the graph opens on the replica you highlighted;
from the service row it opens on the first.

The last fifteen minutes are already there when the view opens. Each
node collects its containers' usage in the background while SwarmCLI is
connected, so you are looking at what happened *before* you went to
look — not at a graph that starts filling in from the moment you arrive.

### Reading the view

Four panes: **CPU**, **MEM**, **NET rx/tx** and **BLK r/w**. Each names
its current, average and peak value for the span on screen.

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `w` | Cycle the span: 1 minute → 5 minutes → 15 minutes |
| `p` | Pause. The graph freezes so a spike can be read; press again to catch up |
| `n` / `N` | Step to the next / previous replica of the same service |
| `?` | Full help: the keys, and what each pane is showing |
| `Esc` | Back |

The memory pane is scaled to the container's **own** limit when its
service declares one (`deploy.resources.limits.memory`), so the graph
answers "how close is this to being killed". A container with no limit
is scaled to its own peak instead, and the pane is titled `MEM` rather
than `MEM / <limit>` — the daemon reports the whole host's memory as an
unconstrained container's limit, and a percentage of that would tell you
nothing about the container.

CPU is the same figure `docker stats` reports, and is scaled by core
count: a container fully using two cores reads 200%.

Below about 90 columns the four panes stack into one column and as many
as fit are drawn.

### What is measured, and what is not

A pane reads **`not reported by this host`** when the host does not
publish that metric at all. That is deliberately distinct from a flat
line at zero, which means the container really did nothing.

Common reasons:

| Pane | Why it may be unavailable |
|---|---|
| NET | The container runs on the host network, so it has no per-interface counters of its own. |
| MEM, BLK | Memory and block I/O both come from cgroup controllers. If the controllers are not delegated to the container's cgroup, the daemon has nothing to report. This is usual under rootless Docker and under Docker-in-Docker, and happens on any host whose cgroup hierarchy does not enable `memory` and `io` for the slice Docker runs in. |

To confirm it is the host rather than SwarmCLI, run `docker stats` against
the same container on that node: it reads the same daemon fields, so it
shows the same gaps. `docker info` also prints a warning line per missing
controller (`No memory limit support`, and similar) at the end of its
output.

A container that restarts inside the window leaves a short gap rather
than a spike: its counters begin again from zero, and a rate derived
across that reset would be fiction.

The graph is a viewer, not a monitoring system. Fifteen minutes is what
the nodes hold; if you need history beyond that, or alerting, run a
metrics stack (cAdvisor, Prometheus) alongside.

### Failure modes

| What you see | Cause |
|---|---|
| `Stats (BE)`, greyed out | No valid license; open `:license`. |
| `Container statistics need up-to-date infrastructure` | The deployed agent predates this feature. Re-run `:bootstrap`. |
| `Container statistics need a bootstrapped Docker context` | The current context talks to a daemon directly. `:contexts` to switch, or `:bootstrap`. |
| `No samples yet` | The node has just started collecting. It fills in within a few seconds. |
| `service … has no running tasks` | Nothing is running to measure. |

## Where the gates live

All four features are license-gated — each is enabled only when the
active license grants it:

- Shell
- Reveal-secret
- Port-forward
- Container statistics

Tier-to-feature mapping is centralised: today, both `be` and `trial`
tiers grant all four features. See [License — Model](license.md#model).
