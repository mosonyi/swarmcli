// checkBindSources refuses a bind mount whose source is not an absolute path.
//
// A swarm bind mount names a path on whichever node runs the task, so a source
// that is not absolute has no referent at all — and nothing downstream says so.
// The docker CLI resolves every bind source against the directory of the compose
// file it was handed (resolveVolumePaths in cli/compose/loader, docker/cli
// v28.5.1), and the compose file swarmcli hands it is the manifest writeStackTree
// just put in a temporary directory. So `./data:/data` has always meant a path
// under swarmcli's own temp directory — on a node that has never heard of it, and
// which swarmcli deletes the moment the deploy returns. `~/data` differs only in
// being legible: expandUser resolves it against the HOME of whoever ran swarmcli,
// which is not the machine the container runs on either.
//
// This runs before the manifest is written, because once the loader has run the
// source has already been rewritten and the evidence is gone — the same reason
// charts.ResolveManifestFiles reads the document rather than the loaded config.
//
// Every deploy passes through here: charts install, upgrade and rollback, and
// the stacks view's three raw paths. They share the temp directory, so they
// share the defect, so they share the refusal.
//
// An absolute source is left alone. A bind naming a real path on a real node is
// a documented and deliberately privileged thing for a swarm service to do, and
// it is a property of compose rather than a swarmcli defect.
//
// swarmcli-cd refuses the same thing in the same words (compose.checkBindSources)
// so that an operator meeting this in both editions meets one rule.
