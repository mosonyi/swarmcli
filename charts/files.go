// breaking change into a support question.

// valuesDir is the one other directory a manifest may name: not a directory on
// anyone's disk, but the effective values, materialised as files.
//
// It exists because a config the OPERATOR supplies had no mechanism at all.
// Compose gives a config its content only through file:, there is no content:
// field to inline with (docker/cli v28.5.1 config_schema_v3.9.json is
// name/file/external/labels/template_driver, additionalProperties: false), and a
// chart naming a path outside itself is exactly what chartFilesRule refuses —
// rightly, since the docker CLI reads it as the invoking operator.
//
// The asymmetry that makes this safe is that the OPERATOR names the path, on
// their own command line (--set-file), and the chart names only a values key. A
// path the operator typed carries the authority they already have; a path a
// chart chose does not. See issue #537.
const valuesDir = "values"

const valuesFilesRule = valuesDir + "/ names a value, which the operator supplies (--set-file <key>=<path>, or a values file)"

// ResolveManifestFiles returns the files a rendered manifest names, and refuses
// every path that cannot mean either a file in the chart or one of values.
//
// Exactly three compose keys read a path — a config's file:, a secret's file:
// and a service's env_file: — and the docker CLI resolves all three against the
// directory of the compose file it was handed, then reads them itself,
// client-side and as the invoking user, before anything reaches the daemon. In
// docker/cli v28.5.1 that is absPath in cli/compose/loader/loader.go for all
// three, then fileObjectConfig in cli/compose/convert/compose.go for the two
// file: keys and parseEnvFile in cli/compose/loader/envfile.go for env_file:.
//
// swarmcli writes that compose file to a temp directory. So an unguarded
// relative path has always meant "a file in the system temp directory" — which
// any local user can plant, against a temp name predictable enough to know when
// to try — and an absolute one has always meant itself, read as the operator
// into a swarm config that anyone with Docker access can read.
//
// This therefore refuses on the way past, in order: a path that is absolute,
// one that escapes the chart, and one that is neither in the chart's files/ nor
// in values/. None of it depends on where the chart was loaded from. Trusting a
// local-path chart with an absolute path would grant the most privilege to
// vendoring a repository chart to disk, which is the workflow that most obscures
// a chart's origin.
//
// A files/ path comes back keyed exactly as Chart.Files keys it; a values/ path
// comes back keyed by the path the manifest wrote, carrying the value's bytes.
// Both are materialised beside the manifest at that relative path — which is
// what makes file: mean the chart, or the operator's own file, and nothing else.
// Only the referenced subset is returned: it is persisted in the release record
// so a rollback replays the bytes the original deploy sent, and that record has
// a hard size ceiling it shares with the manifest.
//
// A manifest naming no file at all yields a nil map and no error, which is every
// manifest a chart without a files/ directory can produce.
