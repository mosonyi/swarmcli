// writes a sequence node per byte — "files/a.conf:\n    - 104\n    - 101" —
// which is roughly 13 characters of YAML for every byte of content, and gzip
// only partly undoes it because what it then compresses is decimal digits
// rather than the content's own redundancy. Measured through this exact path
// (yaml.Marshal then gzipBytes) with 100 KiB of nginx-style config: 1,378,425
// bytes of YAML and 18,365 gzipped, against 136,823 and 5,784 for base64 —
// where gzipping the content on its own is 4,356. For incompressible content, a
// certificate or a keyring, the integer sequence costs ~1.7x the raw size
// gzipped (172,006 for 100 KiB) where base64 costs ~1.006x (103,090).
//
// That matters because the budget is not notional: the record is one Docker
// Config, maxConfigPayload is measured after gzip, and a chart's files spend
// that budget alongside the rendered manifest they belong to. Every byte the
// encoding wastes is a byte of chart content that cannot ship.
//
// It is fixed here rather than later because this is a stored format. A record
// written under one encoding has to be readable by whatever reads it next —
// history, status, rollback — so changing it after releases exist in the field
// means either a migration or a reader that understands both. There is no
// version marker in the payload to hang that off.
//
// Nil and empty both marshal to nil, so `omitempty` still elides the key and a
// release with no files stores exactly the bytes it stored before this type
// existed; both decode back to nil, so a rollback of such a release deploys no
