# Editions: the two artefacts, and which one you have

Every release publishes **two** artefacts from one tag. They are built from
different trees, they are named differently, and one of them can be unlocked by
a licence. This page is what each of them is.

| | Built from | Contains | Licence |
|---|---|---|---|
| `swarmcli_*` archives, `eldaratech/swarmcli:<tag>`, `:latest`, the `swarmcli` Homebrew cask and Scoop manifest | a private build wrapper around this repository | this repository, plus licensed code that is **inert** without a licence | this repository's code is Apache-2.0; the licensed code is proprietary |
| `swarmcli-oss_*` archives, `eldaratech/swarmcli:<tag>-oss`, the `swarmcli-oss` cask and manifest | this repository, and nothing else | this repository, and nothing else | wholly Apache-2.0 |

The command inside both archives is `swarmcli`. Every invocation in these docs,
every script, alias and CI job is identical for the two, deliberately: the
difference between them is what the build contains, not how it is driven.

## Why there are two

The default artefact carries the licensed code because a single binary is the
only arrangement in which "install a licence" is not "download a different
product". Nothing is hidden by that — the code is compiled in and does nothing
until a licence verifies.

But a released binary that contains proprietary code cannot honestly be called
open source, and a project whose only download is that binary has no answer when
somebody says so. `swarmcli-oss` is the answer, and it only works if it ships
from the first merged release rather than after somebody complains. It is also
the artefact a distribution packager, an air-gapped compliance review and a
contributor verifying what they built actually need.

The OSS build is not a subset with features removed. It is this repository,
which is the whole Community Edition: the TUI, the chart package manager, the
declarative `charts apply` workflow, the CLI. Nothing that has ever shipped
Apache-2.0 is reclaimable; the free line is drawn there or wider, never
narrower.

## Which one am I running

Three signals, in descending order of how much you should trust them.

**`swarmcli version`.** The strongest, because it is a property of the build and
nothing at runtime can change it:

```console
$ swarmcli version
1.14.0 (oss build)
```

`(business build)` is the merged artefact — **whether or not a licence
verified**. That is exactly what distinguishes "this binary has no licensed
code" from "this binary has no licence", and neither the edition label nor the
absence of features answers that alone.

**The startup log line**, for a binary you cannot re-run:

```
swarmcli version=1.14.0 edition=ce commit=… date=…      ← the OSS build
swarmcli-be version=1.14.0 commit=… date=…              ← the merged build
```

The prefix is the signal, and it is written on every start, including
non-interactive `swarmcli charts …` runs.

**The edition label in the TUI header** is the weakest of the three, and is not
a build signal at all: it follows live licence state, so the merged build with
no valid licence reads *Community Edition* — correctly, because that is what it
is behaving as. Do not use it to answer this question.

## What a licence changes, and when

A licence is installed into the swarm and read at startup. It turns features on
in the merged build only — there is nothing in the OSS build for it to unlock,
and installing one there changes nothing and reports nothing.

The Business Edition documentation covers acquiring, installing and managing a
key, and what each feature does.

## Getting the OSS build

```bash
# The archive, from any release:
curl -sSLO https://github.com/Eldara-Tech/swarmcli/releases/download/v1.14.0/swarmcli-oss_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz

# The image:
docker pull eldaratech/swarmcli:v1.14.0-oss

# Homebrew or Scoop:
brew install Eldara-Tech/tap/swarmcli-oss
scoop install swarmcli-oss
```

There is deliberately no moving `:oss` image tag and no `:latest` on this half.
A deployment that wants the verifiably-Apache-2.0 artefact pins a version, which
is what an air-gapped or compliance-reviewed deployment does anyway — and a
moving tag on the artefact whose whole point is being checkable is a way to be
surprised by what is running.

`checksums-oss.txt` in each release covers these artefacts;
`checksums-merged.txt` covers the merged ones. Neither is named plain
`checksums.txt`: a release carries two sets of artefacts, and an unqualified
name would not say which set it verified.

Building it yourself is the same thing:

```bash
go build -o swarmcli .
```

## How the claim is checked rather than remembered

`swarmcli-oss` is only worth publishing while "this one is the Apache-2.0 build"
is something you can verify rather than something we assert. So it is checked on
the artefact, not on the source:
[`scripts/check-oss-artefact.sh`](../scripts/check-oss-artefact.sh) reads the
module graph Go stamped into each published binary and fails if the main module
is not this repository or if anything private is linked. It runs from
`.goreleaser.yml`'s per-build hook on every binary the release publishes, and
from `ci.yml` on every change — so it is not a gate that only ever fires on a
tag.

It also fails when it cannot read a module stamp at all, rather than passing.
A binary whose graph is unreadable looks exactly like a binary with no private
dependencies, and that is the shape of every guard that quietly stops guarding.
