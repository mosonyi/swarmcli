# Volumes

The Volumes view lists Docker volumes and — on Business Edition — lets you
manage them across the whole swarm. The read-only view is part of the base
TUI; listing volumes on **all** nodes and the create / delete / prune / file-browse
actions are license-gated and require a managed context.

Open it from the command bar:

```text
:volume
```

What you can do depends on two things:

- **License.** The `volumes-all-nodes` entitlement (granted on the `be` and
  `trial` tiers — see [License](license.md)) unlocks cross-node listing and all
  management actions.
- **Context.** Cross-node operations talk to the per-node agents through the
  RBAC proxy, so they need a managed Docker context (a swarm that has been put
  through [`:bootstrap`](bootstrap.md)). On a non-managed context the view falls
  back to the connected node only.

## The Volumes view

The list has six columns:

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| NAME | Volume name. |
| STACK | Owning stack (from the `com.docker.stack.namespace` label), or `-`. |
| DRIVER | Volume driver (`local`, …). |
| MOUNT POINT | On-disk path of the volume on its node. |
| CREATED | Creation timestamp. |
| HOST | The node the volume lives on. |

Navigation and inspection:

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `↑`/`↓` (`k`/`j`) | Move cursor |
| `pgup` / `pgdown` | Page up / down |
| `i` / `enter` | Inspect the selected volume (JSON viewer) |
| `/` | Filter (matches name, stack, driver, mount point, host) |
| `?` | Full help |
| `esc` / `q` | Back |

Sort with `shift`+ the column initial; press the same key again to flip the
direction:

| Key | Sort by |
|---|---|
| `shift+n` | Name |
| `shift+s` | Stack |
| `shift+d` | Driver |
| `shift+c` | Created |
| `shift+h` | Host |

### Scope: connected node vs. all nodes

Without the license, the view lists volumes **on the connected node only** and
shows a footer hint:

```text
Connected node only · listing volumes on all nodes is a Business Edition feature: …
```

With `volumes-all-nodes` licensed on a managed context, the view aggregates
volumes from every node in the swarm (the HOST column tells you where each one
lives). Two degraded states surface as a non-fatal banner rather than an error:

- **Not bootstrapped** (licensed, but the context has no managed proxy):
  `Connected node only · cross-node volume management needs :bootstrap`.
- **Some nodes unreachable**: the reachable volumes are still listed, with an
  "N nodes unreachable" banner — the listing degrades, it does not fail.

## Managing volumes

The management actions are license-gated. On an unlicensed or non-managed
context the keys still exist but open a "Business Edition feature" dialog
instead of acting.

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `c` | Create a volume |
| `b` | Browse files in the selected volume |
| `ctrl+d` | Delete the selected volume |
| `p` | Prune unused volumes |

### Create (`c`)

Opens a form with a **Name** field and a **Node** picker (the swarm's nodes).
`tab` cycles focus, the arrow keys choose the node, `enter` creates, `esc`
cancels. Volumes are created with the `local` driver.

### Delete (`ctrl+d`)

Asks for confirmation — `Delete volume '<name>' on <host>? This cannot be
undone.` — then removes the volume on its node. `y`/`enter` confirms, `n`/`esc`
cancels. Deleting a volume that is still mounted by a container fails with an
"in use" error; stop the consumer first.

### Prune (`p`)

Removes **unused** volumes (`docker volume prune --all`). Pick a single node, or
toggle **Prune all nodes** with `space` to run it across the whole swarm. After
confirming, the result dialog reports how many volumes were deleted, how much
space was reclaimed, and any per-node errors.

### Browse files (`b`)

Opens an in-volume file browser rooted at the volume's contents:

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `↑`/`↓` (`k`/`j`) | Move cursor |
| `enter` / `→` | Enter directory / select file |
| `p` / `backspace` / `←` | Up to parent directory |
| `r` | Rename the selected entry |
| `ctrl+d` / `delete` | Delete the selected entry |
| `d` | Download to your local machine |
| `u` | Upload from your local machine |
| `esc` | Back |

**Download (`d`)** streams the selected entry to a local path: a file is written
raw, a directory as a `.tar`. The transfer streams with live progress, refuses
to overwrite an existing destination, and writes to a temporary file that is
atomically renamed on success.

**Upload (`u`)** is the inverse — it opens a local file browser (a
`[Upload this directory]` row selects the directory you are browsing). A file is
sent raw into the current directory; a directory is packed and unpacked under
it. Uploads are capped by the agent's `FILEOP_MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES` (default 2 GiB);
exceeding it returns `413`. Operators change the ceiling in the bootstrap stack
and redeploy — see [Configuration](configuration.md).

File operations run inside a short-lived, network-isolated helper container
scoped to the target volume; they do not run on the agent host's filesystem.

## How cross-node access works

Volume operations travel over the same authenticated, authorized path as the
other Business Edition features: swarmcli asks the RBAC proxy, the proxy checks
your role, and the request reaches the node holding the volume.

Listing is aggregated across every node, so you see the whole swarm's volumes
in one view; every other operation is addressed to the node you selected. A
node that is unreachable is reported as such rather than silently omitted.

## Permissions and gating

`volumes-all-nodes` is granted on the `be` and `trial` tiers (see
[License — Model](license.md#model)). When it is off — no license, an expired or
wrong-swarm license, or a non-managed context — the view shows the read-only
connected-node listing and the management keys open the "Business Edition
feature" dialog. Role-based access to the underlying calls is enforced centrally
by the RBAC proxy; see [RBAC](rbac.md).

## Failure modes

| What you see | Cause |
|---|---|
| "Business Edition feature" dialog on `c`/`b`/`ctrl+d`/`p` | No `volumes-all-nodes` entitlement, or a non-managed context. Open `:license`, or switch to a bootstrapped context. |
| `Connected node only · cross-node volume management needs :bootstrap` | Licensed, but the active context has no managed proxy. Run [`:bootstrap`](bootstrap.md). |
| "N nodes unreachable" banner | Some agents did not answer in time; the listing shows the reachable nodes. Check `:bootstrap --check`. |
| Delete fails with an "in use" error | The volume is still mounted by a running container. Remove or stop the consumer, then retry. |
| `upload exceeds the maximum size of <N> bytes` (413) | The upload is larger than `FILEOP_MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES`. Raise the limit in the bootstrap stack and redeploy, or split the upload. |
