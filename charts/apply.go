// as Plan.Orphaned, where its owner stamp names this file and it is therefore
// provably obsolete. Only the second is safe to remove, which is what the stamp
// exists to establish; acting on it is a separate change.
//
// Unchanged releases are skipped entirely. That is not an optimisation but a
// requirement: history is one Docker Config per revision, so an apply that
// recorded a revision even when nothing changed would grow the swarm's config
// store on every CI run, forever.
//
// It stops at the first failure and returns the results completed so far

// A cancelled context stops it the same way, and at the same seam: the next
// release is never started, and the error is the context's, so a caller can tell

// version bump nor a manifest change — editing files/nginx.conf and re-running
// `charts apply ./mychart` is the local-development loop — and while that
// comparison was missing, such a release planned as ActionUnchanged and the
// edited bytes never left the machine. Nil and empty compare equal: one means
// "this release ships no files" and so does the other.
//
// Requirements are deliberately not compared, and that asymmetry is meant. They
// declare what must already exist on the swarm for a deploy to work — external
// networks, secrets, configs — and are re-rendered and re-checked at pre-flight
// on every deploy that happens; they are not content the deploy sends. A
// requirements-only edit therefore changes nothing about the deployed release,
// and forcing a revision for it would spend a Docker Config to record a
// no-change. Adding them here would need its own argument, not this one.

// prune has. deployAndRecord is the sole writer of rel.Owner, and Apply skips
// ActionUnchanged without calling it, so leaving the owner out of this
// comparison meant a handover between two manifests with byte-identical content
// silently never happened: the plan reported "unchanged", which was true of the
// deployed resources and false of the ownership, and every later plan kept
// classifying the release under the departed owner (#511).
//
// A stamp is only *contradicted* when it names someone else. An absent stamp is
// not a mismatch: an unowned release is already classified conservatively — it
// falls to Plan.Unmanaged rather than Plan.Orphaned — so forcing a revision to
// stamp it would buy no safety, and would re-deploy every release installed
// before owner stamping existed on the first apply after upgrading. An
// unparseable stamp is no evidence of anything, so it is a mismatch and gets
// healed. An empty plan owner never forces: an apply that claims nothing must
